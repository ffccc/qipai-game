======================================================================================

Cross Platform Object Oriented Input Lib System. Meant to be very robust and 
compatiable with many systems and operating systems

Win32/
	Contains Visual Studio .Net Solution Files
	Contains CodeBlocks + MinGW + StlPort project files for OIS
	
	---- Dependencies ------------------------------------------------------
	DirectInput 8
	Ogre & CEGUI 0.4.0 If building CEGUIOgre OIS Demo

	SDL/
		A test bed for an OIS InputManager with SDL as the backend. Not recommended;
		however, useful for platforms with non-native OIS ports for temporary use.

Linux/
	---- Dependencies ------------------------------------------------------
	X11
	Ogre (GLX Platform) & CEGUI 0.4.0 If building CEGUIOgre OIS Demo
        Newer Linux Kernel (2.6+ ?) for Event API - else, use --disable-joyevents

	Steps to build on Linux:
	./bootstrap
	./configure
	./make && make install

	---- Configure build options --------------------------------------------
	./configure --help              --- List all configure options
	./configure --disable-ogre      --- Disables CEGUIOgre ActionMapping Demo
	./configure --disable-joyevents --- Uses /dev/input/jsX instead of 
	                                    /dev/input/eventX

LinuxCB/
        Contains CodeBlock files for building OIS and Demos with codeblocks
        This project file looks for Ogre and other dependencies in /usr/local/lib
        and /usr/local/include. If installed elsewhere, modify the project
        settings. It also installs libOIS to ~/libs

Mac/
	
	XCode-1.5/
		Non-complete native OIS port.

	XCode-2.2/
		Working, complete, OIS port to OSX using SDL as a backend.
