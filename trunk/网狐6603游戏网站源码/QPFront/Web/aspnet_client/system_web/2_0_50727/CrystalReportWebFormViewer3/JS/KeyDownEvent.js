    this function is used to verify whether the 'Enter' key is pressed.
    if the 'Enter' key is pressed, then either call the event handler function passed in as a parameter (evntHdlrName)
    or if evntHdlrName is an empty string, submit the form that contains the input box (that triggers this function).  
    The form name is passed in as the third parameter, if it's an empty string, it's set to 0 by default.
    The first parameter is an event object
