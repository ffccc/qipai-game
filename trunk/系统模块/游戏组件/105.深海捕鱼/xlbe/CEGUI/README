This software uses the Freetype2 library to provide most of the font loading and
rendering support.  Freetype2 is a free, high-quality, and portable font engine;

This software can be compiled in such a way that certain components contain an
embedded copy of the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library.  Please see the

This is Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2; a free library providing windowing and
widgets for graphics APIs and engines where such functionality is not natively
available or is severely lacking. The library is written in C++, is object
orientated, and is primarily targeted at games developers who should be spending
their time creating great games, not building GUI sub-systems...

Note: In various documentation and online, the system is additionally referred
to as both CEGUI (which is the main namespace name), and cegui_mk2 (which is the
CVS module name of the Mk2 version of the system).


Documentation
=============
See also the following files:
COPYING   - Contains the license terms for using the library.
AUTHORS   - Contains a list of authors and contributors.

API documentation built from the source by Doxygen
(http://www.doxygen.org) is available, and can be found online at
http://www.cegui.org.uk/api_reference/.  For the very latest
information and help, visit the project home page at

Supported Systems
=================
Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2 is currently known to compile and run on the
following systems:

*Various flavors of Linux using gcc.
*Microsoft Windows running VC++7.0 up and until VC++9, both 'express' and
 'professional' versions.
*Apple Mac OS X running Xcode.

It is very possible that the system will compile and run on other systems and
compilers, though the above systems have been tested.

NOTE: a long while ago VC6 support has been dropped.

Requirements
============
As well as one of the above supported systems, Crazy Eddie's GUI System Mk-2
also requires the use of some third party external libraries.  These libraries
are as follows:

Freetype2 (http://www.freetype.org)
PCRE (http://www.pcre.org)

Optionally: Xerces-C++ XML parser (http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c)
